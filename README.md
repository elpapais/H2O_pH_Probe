H2O_pH_Probe
============

This is a repository for the code and other files pertaining to the H2O pH probe, a project created by SFE engineer Joel for the Engineering Round Table series.

A wishlist of all the SparkFun parts used in this project can be found [here](http://sfe.io/w72517). The only other components needed are a 4.7Kohm resistor and some hookup wire. 

Here is the video for the project.
